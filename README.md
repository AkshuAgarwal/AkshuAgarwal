## About
I'm Akshit Agarwal, or you can call me Akshu. I'm a High School Student from India. I'm particularly interested in Programming and Robotics kinda stuff a lot! I spend my free time Coding, playing Piano and listening to Music.
<br><br>
My primary languages (in which most of my work is) are Python, HTML and CSS. Looking forward to learn C++ or Java as my next primary language. Most of my work is Private so you might not find much on my Github.
